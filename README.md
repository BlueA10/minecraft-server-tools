Some tools I use to help manage my small Minecraft server.

Includes scripts for starting and stopping the server, taking backups of the world with borg, and sending status messages to a discord webhook.

Very very rough and WIP, it's pretty clearly just for my personal uses and isn't very user friendly to anyone, but I'm keeping it here for the obvious version control reasons and also in case anyone else finds them useful.

May add more documentation in the future if it grows enough.
